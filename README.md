## List of various resources and training guides that I think are pertinent to the development of a data analyst, data scientist & ml engineer


### Data Analysts

[Data Analyst Skills Guide](data-analyst-skills-guide.md)
A complete list of eveything I could possibly think of that would make you a data ninja.

### Beginner ML

[Beginner ML](beginner-ml.md)
I found this one on reddit but found it to be a fairly comprehensive starting point for anyone that wants to get into machine learning. This is assuming you've master the skills required to be a data analyst first.

### ML Engineering

[ML Engineering](ml-engineering.md)
In this one I went with an abundance of various technologies that I've used over the years. It might be a little over kill especially on the web development side but that was where I started and it helped me build a solid foundation of how the internet and websites work so it might help you too.

This assumes you've already mastered a lot of the topics in the beginner ml section.
